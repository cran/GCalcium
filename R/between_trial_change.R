#' @description `between_trial_change` finds the difference in means during same time range between sets of trials.

#' @param Dataframe a GCaMP-format data frame or matrix
#' @param TrialRange1 range of trial numbers to be compared to second set of trials
#' @param TrialRange2 range of trial numbers to be compared to first set of trials
#' @param Time.period range of time to be compared between sets of trials
#' @return Number representing mean difference of trial set 2 and trial set 1

#' # How much did the mean value change 2s after epoc between trials 1-5 and trials 6-10?
